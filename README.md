This project creates a stereo-vision system with a laptop and two webcams. The stereo-vision system was then used to track a red ball in three dimensions and plot its path in real time in attempt to 'paint' in 3d with the ball. ultimately the project succeeded, but ran very slowly; making painting impractical due to lag.
