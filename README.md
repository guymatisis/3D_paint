This project creates a stereo-vision system with a laptop and two webcams. The stereo-vision system was then used to track a red ball in three dimensions and plot its path in real time in attempt to 'paint' in 3d with the ball. The PDF file explains the project in depth.

The project was predominantly written in c/c++, but there is also a small section written in python in order to utilize some plotting libraries.
